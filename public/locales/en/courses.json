  "htmlIntro.welcome": "Hey there, future web wizard! Ready to dive into your first mission? Today, we're uncovering the secret language of the internet: HTML! Think of it as your digital LEGO set.",
  "htmlIntro.whatIsHtml.heading": "What is HTML?",
  "htmlIntro.whatIsHtml.text": "HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's not a programming language like magic spells, but a markup language – like a detailed blueprint that tells your web browser what content to display and where.",
  "htmlIntro.whyImportant.heading": "Why is HTML important?",
  "htmlIntro.whyImportant.text": "Without HTML, your browser wouldn't know if text is a title, a paragraph, or a secret message! It's the skeleton of every webpage.",
  "htmlIntro.whyImportant.caption": "Imagine trying to build a castle without a plan! That's what a webpage would be without HTML. It gives everything its place.",

  "tagsElements.title": "Chapter 2: Your First Magic Words: Tags and Elements!",
  "tagsElements.welcome": "Welcome back, adventurer! Now that we know what HTML is, let's learn its basic components: Tags and Elements. These are your digital LEGO bricks!",
  "tagsElements.whatAreTags.heading": "What are Tags?",
  "tagsElements.whatAreTags.explanation": "HTML uses tags to markup (or label) content. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag <tag> and a closing tag </tag>. The <p> is the opening tag, </p> is the closing tag. Together, they tell the browser: \"Hey, everything in between is a paragraph!\"",
  "tagsElements.whatAreElements.heading": "What are Elements?",
  "tagsElements.whatAreElements.text": "An element is made up of the opening tag, the closing tag, and all the content in between! So, <p>This is a paragraph!</p> is one complete HTML element.",
  "tagsElements.challenge.question": "Can you help our Web Builder Bot complete the HTML sentence?",
  "tagsElements.challenge.instruction": "Which tags would you use for a heading: \"This is a heading for my webpage!\"",
  "tagsElements.challenge.option1": "<h1> and </h1>",
  "tagsElements.challenge.option2": "<title> and </title>",
  "tagsElements.challenge.option3": "<head> and </head>",
  "tagsElements.challenge.correct": "🎉 LEVEL UP! You just mastered your first tags!",
  "tagsElements.challenge.correctCaption": "Incredible! You earned the Tag Master badge! Keep up the great work!",
  "tagsElements.challenge.incorrect": "Hmm, not quite the right spell!",
  "tagsElements.challenge.incorrectCaption": "Close, but not a heading tag. Think about what makes text big and bold on a page!",
  "tagsElements.challenge.hint": "Remember, headings are important for structure. Headings use numbers like h1, h2, etc.",
